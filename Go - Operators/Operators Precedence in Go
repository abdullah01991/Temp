Operator	Description	Example
+	Adds two operands	== A + B gives 30
-	Subtracts second operand from the first	== A - B gives -10
*	Multiplies both operands	== A * B gives 200
/	Divides the numerator by the denominator.	== B / A gives 2
%	Modulus operator; gives the remainder after an integer division.	== B % A gives 0
++	Increment operator. It increases the integer value by one.	== A++ gives 11
--	Decrement operator. It decreases the integer value by one.	== A-- gives 9

Logical Operators
The following table lists all the logical operators supported by Go language. Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then −

ShowExamples

Operator	Description	Example
&&	Called Logical AND operator.
If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A && B) is false.

||	Called Logical OR Operator.
If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.	(A || B) is true.

!	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand.
If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.	!(A && B) is true.
